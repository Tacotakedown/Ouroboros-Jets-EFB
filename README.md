# Ouroboros Jets EFB

![EFB](https://github.com/Tacotakedown/Ouroboros-Jets-EFB/blob/main/preview.png?raw=true)

This repo is a independent version of the EFB that we work on independently to avoid touching the sim, no one likes using the sim. Actions that will never work in this repo: pushback, doors, etc. 


## APIs

If you actually plan on running this on a local machine, there are multiple APIs that you will need to have keys for:
 - Navigraph
 - AVWX rest
 - AIRPORT DB (this shit is going to be gone any day
a sample .env is located in the repo, just replace with your keys and the app should have full functionality



## Scripts
`npm run dev` or `yarn dev` will allow you to run the app in your browser
i will not be adding build scripts for the sim in this repo ever, cope ig

## contributing
don't its a mess, wait till its in the ejet repo
